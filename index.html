    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/profile_pic_1.png" alt="Photo of me" class="profile_pic">
    <p>After many years of outdoor endeavors, I have decided to apply my love of logic and 
      problem solving to a new career.  Learning to code has been surprisingly enjoyable and 
      rewarding, and I am excited about all the new possibilities.  Most of my professional 
      experience is in retail sales and management, which has allowed me to develop diverse and 
      useful skills, but I believe those can be applied in a new, more rewarding field.
    </p>
    <p>I have worked in the retail nursery industry for about a decade, combined.  I also 
      completed a three year-internship on an organic farm, learning to raise livestock and 
      vegetables, and how to structure a self-sustaining business in such a challenging market.  
      I was a Natural Resources Management volunteer with the Peace Corps in Niger, and I am an 
      avid gardener on my own time.  I enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion for both ornamental 
      and edible plants with others.
    </p>
    <p>I like to spend time exploring Richmond's park system with my dogs and with friends; I contribute to 
      plant identification projects using the iNaturalist app.  Indoor hobbies include cross-stitch 
      embroidery, card games and tabletop games, and reading.  I have a particular appreciation for 
      the science fiction and fantasy genres, and I can get lost in books.  I am a word nerd, 
      an introvert, and a connoisseur of well-crafted sarcasm.
